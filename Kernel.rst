Kernel
############################################################

Abstract
============================================================

This is the **official legislative kernel** of Theodia.  The purpose of this document is primarily **to legally bootstrap** the country's legislation;  but it is also to ensure that the founder can continue work on the country in the face of overwhelmingly inactive citizens, something that has thus far endemically plagued the country;  or in the event that some sort of legal coup is staged.

Contents
============================================================

Dictator
------------------------------------------------------------

- The founder of the original Kingdom of Theodia, whence this Theodia is derived, **indefinitely has infinite and absolute power** in the country;  **this cannot be changed** except by ser own hand and of ser own free will.

- There are **never to be any other dictators** instituted in Theodia;  this **also cannot be changed** except by this person alone, by ser hand and ser free will.

Notes
------------------------------------------------------------

- At this time, there is **no way by which to ammend** this kernel, except by the afore-defined dictator.

- This kernel may eventually be replaced by a proper constitution;  but, for the time-being, it is as intended:  **a microkernel**.

Bootstrap
------------------------------------------------------------

- All **non-kernel legislation** is located in ``./Code`` or thence, recursively.

- This non-kernel legislation **has the legal power to do anything**, apart from contradict this kernel;  and this includes the power to restrict what other legislation can legally do.

- All non-kernel legislation considers the directory of this file to be its root directory.
