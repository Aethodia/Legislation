#.  Preface

    #.  All policy is subject to the same primary and secondary ablatives, locatives, and datives.
    #.  Ablatives are justifications.
    #.  Locatives are structure.
    #.  Datives are goals.
    #.  Primary ablatives, locatives, and datives may never be counteracted.
    #.  All policies must meet at at least one ablative, locative, and dative.

#.  Ablatives

    #.  Primary

        #.  The policy must be realistic;  it must be fully within the power of the government to enact and enforce.

    #.  Secondary

        #.  The policy should be empirically justified.
        #.  The policy should be rationally justified.

#.  Locatives

    #.  Primary

        #.  The policy must consist only of the policy:  anything extraneous to the policy's stated intentions should not be included.

    #.  Secondary

        #.  The policy should be elegant:  as simple as possible while still achieving its desired effect(s).

#.  Datives

    #.  Primary

        #.  Ensure the continued existence of this society.
        #.  Improve all citizens' quality of life.

    #.  Secondary

        #.  Reduce corruption.
        #.  Advance scientific understanding.
        #.  Improve the economy.

    #.  For all datives, the long-term should be prioritized over the short-term.
