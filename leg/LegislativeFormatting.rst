A.  Abstract
===========
#.  This file denotes the formatting-requirements which must be met in order for a prospective piece of legislation to be legally added to this repository.

B.  Contents
===========
#.  All legislation should adhere to the item(s) headed by this item:
    
    #.  Have filenames that comply with the specifications listed in items that are headed by this item:
        
        #.  Capitalize each word
        #.  Have no spaces
        #.  Have .rst at the end
        #.  Have 20 or fewer characters [1]_, not counting '.rst'
    #.  Have an internal formatting that complies with the specifications listed in items that are headed by this item:
        
        #.  Full compatibility with the reStructuredText format, as specified at ``http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html``, is required.
        #.  At the very beginning of a law-file, there should be metadata that indicates the version and dependencies of the law.  
        #.  Each law should consist of, at a minimum, the following sections:  
            
            #.  'Abstract', which summarizes the law.
            #.  Any number of content-sections, which are the legally binding part of the law.  Likewise, any footnotes pointing to this section are also legally binding.
            #.  'Footnotes', which contains any footnotes used in the law.  If the law has no footnotes, this section may be left out.  
        #.  Outside of the 'Footnotes' section itself, footnotes do not need to appear in order -- although drafters are encouraged to place them so.
        #.  The most important parts of a law should properly be emboldened [2]_.
#.  All legislation should be interpreted per the item(s) headed by this item:
        
    #.  All numbers are assumed to be in base-twelve, unless otherwise specified
