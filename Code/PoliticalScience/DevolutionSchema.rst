Bindings
------------------------------------------------------------

- Every provision in every national law can have one (and only one) of the following bindings:

  #. Always (It is legally applicable in all devolutions.)

  #. Opt-out (It is legally applicable in all devolutions that have not opted-out of it.)

  #. Opt-in (It is only legally applicable in devolutions that have opted-in to it.)

  #. Never (It is only applicable to the national government and in its direct holdings.)

- The default binding (where one is not explicitly stated) is "Opt-out".
