LegalInterpretation
############################################################

Abstract
============================================================

This file defines **how to interpret laws**.

Contents
============================================================

- Every law must be interpreted per the official legal language. [2]_

- Only the 'Contents' [1]_ section of a law is legally binding.

- The 'Footnotes' [1]_ section, while not itself legally binding, can serve as a guide when interpreting something that *is*.

- A legally-active file in this repository is a "Law", and its legally-binding subcomponents are "provisions".

- Wherever not explicitly stated, legal provisions are assumed to use the binding-level that ``DevolutionSchema`` sets as default.

Footnotes
============================================================

.. [1] See ``LegalTextSpec:Structure``.

.. [2] The current legal language is specified in ``NationalSymbols``.  It is worth noting, that since this language is, presently, Theodian English;  all numbers in legislation are dozenal (duodecimal).
