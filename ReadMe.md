# About

The items in either the same directory as, or any sub-directory of, this ReadMe, recursively speaking, apart from `.` and 
`..`, and apart from `./ReadMe.md` and `./License.txt`, collectively **comprise the entirety of Theodian legislation**.  

Everything in this repository (with the exception of things in `./res`) are **encoded in UTF-8** (8-byte Unicode Text-Format) and use **UNIX line-endings**.  

# Where to start

`./Kernel.rst` is the **legally-binding core** of Theodia's laws, and it **bootstraps all other legal components**.  These 
components are all located in `./leg`.  

Within that folder, among other things, can be found an explanation of how Theodia's legislative processes work (for those 
interested in contributing).
