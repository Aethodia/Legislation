#.  Preface

    #.  **All policy is subject to** the same primary and secondary **ablatives**, **locatives**, and **datives** [1]_.

    #.  **Ablatives are justifications**.

    #.  **Locatives are structure**.

    #.  **Datives are goals**.

    #.  **Primary** ablatives, locatives, and datives **may never be counteracted**.

    #.  All **policies must meet at at least one** ablative, locative, and dative.

#.  Ablatives

    #.  Primary

        #.  The **policy must be realistic**;  it must be fully within the power of the government to enact and enforce.

    #.  Secondary

        #.  The **policy should be empirically justified**.

        #.  The **policy should be rationally justified**.

#.  Locatives

    #.  Primary

        #.  The policy must consist only of the policy:  **anything extraneous** to the policy's stated intentions **should not be included**.

    #.  Secondary

        #.  The **policy should be elegant**:  as simple as possible while still achieving its desired effect(s).

#.  Datives

    #.  Primary

        #.  **Ensure** the continued **existence of** this **society**.

        #.  **Improve** all **citizens'** quality of **life**.

    #.  Secondary

        #.  Optimize and **improve** anything and **everything**.

        #.  **Advance** scientific **understanding**.

    #.  For all datives, the **long-term** should be prioritized **over** the **short-term**.

.. [1] While this may seem like strange terminology, it directly corresponds to one of Theodian's case axies.  Fundamentally, "ablative, locative, dative" corresponds to "from, at, to".  In this law, ablatives represent source information, locatives reprensent the state of the policy itself, and datives represent the goal(s) of the policy;  as such, the chosen vocabulary is hardly inaccurate.
