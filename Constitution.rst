Introduction
============
| This is the official constitution of the country Theodia.  The purpose of this document is primarily to legally bootstrap 
  the legislative kernel;  but it is also to ensure that the founder can continue work on the country in the face of 
  overwhelmingly inactive citizens, something that has thus far endemically plagued the country.  

Head of state
=============
| The founder of the original Kingdom of Theodia, whence this Theodia is derived, indefinitely has infinite and absolute power 
  in the country;  this cannot be changed except by ser own hand and of ser own free will.  There are never to be any other 
  dictators instituted in Theodia;  this also cannot be changed except by this person alone, by hirs hand and hirs free 
  will.  

Bootstrap
=========
| ./Kernel.rst is responsible for generating all non-constitutional law in the country.  It may delegate power as necessary.  
  Ammendments to this constitution are to be done as specified by the kernel.
